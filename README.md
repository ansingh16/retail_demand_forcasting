# 🛍️ Retail Demand Forecasting App

A project to forecast retail product demand using **real-world product data** (Open Food Facts), **price and review trends from online retailers**, and **external drivers** like weather and public holidays. This project demonstrates the full machine learning pipeline — from data collection to model training to app deployment — using only open or scraped data.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Traditional retail demand forecasting models often rely on proprietary datasets. This project showcases a practical alternative using:

- 🛒 **Open Food Facts API** – for product metadata (name, category, brand, etc.)
- 💹 **Web-scraped price and review history** – to approximate demand trends over time
- 🌦️ **Weather API** – to introduce real-world variability in consumer behavior
- 🎉 **Holiday calendar** – to model seasonal and event-driven demand
- 🤖 **Machine learning (XGBoost, Prophet)** – to forecast short-term demand
- 📊 **Streamlit dashboard** – for interactive visualization and prediction
